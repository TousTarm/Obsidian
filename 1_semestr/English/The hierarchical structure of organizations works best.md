Hierarchical structures are an often ocouring fenomen in societies trougout the history. It showed itself as an effective tool and here are some reasons why.

Hierarchical structure creates one of the safest enviroments for employees, since there is always someone to report, someone to ask for directions or someone, who can check your work and avoid potential failures. In fact, according to a study concluded in 2021 by McKinsey & Company, 62% of employees in hierarchical organizations felt that they have a clear understanding of whom to report. This lowers the risk of failure and guarantees smoother workings of a company.

On the other hand, this also slows the company down, since for a change to be made, there has to be way more people involved, resulting in slower adapting to changes in the market. This claim is supported by study also from McKinsey & Company, that shows companies with hierarchical structures are 20% slower in adapting to changes in market compared to decentralized ones.

Even tough most companies still use hierarchical structures due to their scale. Huge decentralized companies are nearly impossible to manage, since employees are managing them selves, resulting in chaos and inefficency of the company.

In spite of new companies being mainly decentralized, most of the succesfull companies still remain hierarchical.
